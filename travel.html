                    Buses in Mallorca are an efficient and affordable way to explore the island, offering a reliable network that connects major towns, cities, and tourist hotspots. Operated primarily by TIB (Transport de les Illes Balears) and EMT in Palma, these services are modern, air-conditioned, and generally punctual. Whether you're heading to Palma’s historic center, the beaches of Alcúdia, or the scenic mountain villages of Sóller and Valldemossa, buses provide an eco-friendly option. Tickets can be purchased on board or via apps, with discounts available for contactless payments.

                <p>
                    Taxis are a convenient and popular way to get around Mallorca, offering a comfortable and direct mode of transport for both locals and visitors. Available throughout the island, taxis can be hailed on the street, found at designated taxi ranks, or booked in advance via phone or apps. They are regulated by the government, ensuring fair pricing and safety for passengers. Taxis are typically well-maintained, air-conditioned, and can accommodate up to four passengers. For longer trips or airport transfers, taxis provide a hassle-free option, offering door-to-door service. Though slightly more expensive than public transport, taxis are ideal for those who prefer flexibility, privacy, or need to travel to destinations not easily accessible by bus or train. Whether you're heading to the airport, a remote beach, or a mountain village, taxis in Mallorca provide a reliable and efficient way to explore the island.
